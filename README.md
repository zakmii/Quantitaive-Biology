## Needleman–Wunsch Algorithm for Global Alignment with traceback
    Global alignments, which attempt to align every residue in every sequence, are most useful when the sequences in the query set are similar and of roughly equal
    size. (This does not mean global alignments cannot start and/or end in gaps.) The Needleman- Wunsch algorithm is a general global alignment technique which is
    based on dynamic programming.

##  Smith-Waterman algorithm for Local Alignment with traceback
    Local alignments are more useful for dissimilar sequences suspected to contain regions of similarity or similar sequence motifs within their larger 
    sequence context. The Smith–Waterman algorithm is a general local alignment method based on the same dynamic programming scheme but with additional choices to 
    start and end anywhere.
